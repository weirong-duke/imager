# Imager

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am trying to keep the README as sparse as possible; please refer to the provided notes for a more detailed outline of design and decision-making.

## Additional Notes

Additional notes (please read!) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BI2pgPGkHRQ16z_uDO07hZyBkwNmLdlv/view?usp=sharing)

## Node Version

Please note that the Node version used to build this was 16.13.2 (also stated in .nvmrc).

Also, I used yarn and not npm (although both should work fine).

## Bootstrapping

Setup should start running just by running the following.

### `yarn`

This will install dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
